                    <!-- Introduction -->
                    <p>Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially when it comes to their body
                        reacting to
                        certain conditions - emotionally, mentally or physically.</p>
                    <p>These “feelings” tend to get “out of control” during specific phases of our life, the kind that
                        we see in movies but have not explicitly discussed before it happens.
                        We start to sense a shift in the way our body works; drastic mood swings with frequent tears or
                        outbursts</p>
                    <p>The worst part?</p>
                    <p>The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like they think we’re going crazy.
                        Honestly, we are not going crazy… It's just menopause!
                        Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down on our reproductive
                        abilities.
                        And it’s no fun ride. All the mood swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and
                        the never-ending list of problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with, by ourselves.</p>
                    <p>But...</p>
                    <p>Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us simplify the process of solving them (as
                        promised, as easy as 1, 2, 3)! </p>
                    <p>Let us start with understanding the 3 stages of Menopause:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Perimenopause or Premenopause</li>
                            <li>Menopause</li>
                            <li>Postmenopause</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <!-- The 3 Stages of Menopause -->
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The 3 Stages of Menopause</h2>
                    <span><img src="assets/img/Three_phase.png" alt="3 Stages of Menopause" width="700" height="500"></span>

                    <!-- First Stage -->
                    <h4>1. Perimenopause</h4>
                    <p>Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin <b>several years before menopause</b>. This could last
                        between a few months to about 10 years. However, on average it lasts about 4 years.
                        What happens?</p>
                    <p><b>Ovaries start to gradually lower estrogen production</b></p>
                    <p>This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts around the age of 40. In some
                        cases, it could start as early as when women are in their 30s.</p>
                    <p>This could mean a reduction in our fertility rate, therefore, women looking to start a family
                        should try and utilize every open opportunity with their partner!</p>
                    <p><b>Changes in the menstrual/period cycle</b></p>
                    <p>The horror stories begin with the change in duration of our menstrual cycle- there could be
                        longer gaps between periods or spotting between 2 cycles.</p>
                    <p>Like, the frustration of not knowing when you will get your period next is not enough; the flow
                        would differ too, making it heavier or lighter over time.</p>
                    <p><b>Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</b></p>
                    <p>Drastic and frequent mood swings are the most common signals, along with increased insomnia or
                        hot flashes. This could increase our irritability level, losing our energy levels; getting tired
                        even after sitting at work the entire day or taking longer weekend naps to recover from our
                        workweek would be common.</p>

                    <!-- Second Stage -->
                    <h4>2. Menopause</h4>
                    <p>The official menopause stage begins 12 months after the last menstrual period (bleeding).
                        What happens?</p>
                    <p><b>Ovaries stop releasing eggs</b></p>
                    <p>This means there would be minimal production of estrogen. This means there would be minimal
                        production of estrogen.</p>
                    <p>We start feeling “low”, with the constant need to cuddle in bed and watch Netflix instead of
                        going out and getting drinks with our girlfriends.</p>

                    <p><b>Intensified hot flashes and night sweats</b></p>
                    <p>Waking up in the middle of the night, aggressively throwing our blanket away or turning your fan
                        on max even though the aircon is on full blast.</p>
                    <p>Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red skin and increased heart rate;
                        followed by suddenly feeling cold.</p>

                    <p><b>Significant physical changes</b></p>
                    <p>The concept of “a minute on your lip, a lifetime on your hip” comes to reality. Eating one slice
                        of cake for dinner could increase weight around our waist and abdominal region, with a reduction
                        in our metabolic rate.".</p>
                    <p>Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red skin and increased heart rate;
                        followed by suddenly feeling cold.</p>
                    <p>It is also common to notice our hair and skin becoming drier and thinner; no amount of
                        conditioner and lotion seem to absolutely solve this problem.</p>

                            menopause.</a></p>

                    <!-- Third Stage -->
                    <h4>3. Postmenopause</h4>
                    <p>Yes, the troubles don’t end right at menopause. It is the stage where most of the severe
                        menopausal symptoms decrease but it comes with additional side effects. </p>
                    <p>What happens?</p>
                    <p><b>Increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH)</b></p>
                    <p>This increases dramatically as our ovaries shut down and drastically lower the level of estrogen
                        in our body.
                        By this point, we started noticing a lowered energy level - sleeping in by 7/8 P.M. after work
                        is a norm.</p>
                    <p><b>Higher risk of certain health conditions</b></p>
                    <p>Some of the common health problems that occur during postmenopause are diabetes, joint pains,
                        osteoporosis,
                        cholesterol and heart disease.</p>
                    <p>This could be an alarming phase, where every visit to the doctor is like drawing a lottery
                        ticket- we need to
                        maintain a healthy lifestyle to combat such possibilities.</p>

                    <!-- Symptoms of Menopause -->
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Symptoms of Menopause</h2>
                    <span><img src="assets/img/Symptoms.png" alt="Symptoms of Menopause" width="700" height="500"></span>
                    <p>Going through menopause by yourself is hard! Especially because it affects our daily life!
                        Symptoms like
                        reduction in metabolic rates and estrogen levels that cause weight gain and increase the size of
                        our abdomen;
                        night sweats and flashes, joint pains that make us feel 30 years older...are just to name a few.
                    </p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have broken down understanding and solving menopause in 3 easy steps; which can
                        make this
                        journey a little less frustrating!</p>
                    <p>We hope you can see that menopause does not have to be difficult and solving it can be as easy as
                        1, 2, 3!</p>
